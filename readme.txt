README

The D&D Dice Tracker is a python application that tracks dice rolls and plots them on a graph.

To use this application, you will need six tables in a postgres database. It may work with other databases. But no promises - it was only tested with postgres. You will also need plotly, psycopg2, radar, datetime, and random.

It is optimized for Python3. 

This code can easily be modified to accomodate a single die, or as many as you'd like to track. Included is a function that will generate test data for you to experiment with.

Best of luck on your adventures,
